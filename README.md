# Netherportalnomore

No More Nether Portal was created by Gigabit101 to address an issue in Monumental Experience where Nether portals were being created through various meansâ€”such as world generation, portal lighting, and more. This mod prevents unwanted portal creation while still allowing access to the Nether through the Dim Paintings Nether Painting, giving you better control over dimension travel.
